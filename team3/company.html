            Our mission
           </h3>
           <p>
            We want to help more people express themselves and connect through artful stationary products that are affordable, unique, and useful. 
           </p>
            <h3>
                Teamwork
            </h3>
            <p>We work well as a team and have lots of fun while being efficient and creative. 
            We are both good at decision making and work hard while lifting each other up. 
            We are always up for a challenge and build off each other's ideas to make sure we do the best we can. 
            We also make sure to listen to each other, and take into consideration everyoneâ€™s needs when deciding something. 
            We help each other learn new things, making sure that everyone feels included and knows what to do. 
            We allow each other the room to try new things, make mistakes and grow, and we always make sure to get things done on time, to the best of our ability.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Notebooks
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Our notebooks are simple and provide good value, but also high quality. An exclusive art design will be spread across the cover from front to back, giving the notebook a unique touch. Each notebook has 32 pages that can be used for either writing or drawing. Our notebooks are unique but also are durable and useful, creating a stationary product that you can use time and time again and always looks its best. Also, we will take feedback from customers to get ideas for new designs. Each piece of artwork is carefully designed and hand drawn using vibrant watercolors that will bring a smile to your face.

These cards are about 4.5 inches in width and about 6 inches in length, and can easily fit into many different envelopes. We have a wide variety of art card designs and have a feedback form where you can submit . Our cards are also a size that fits into many different types of envelopes, providing you with the option to pick your own envelope.
