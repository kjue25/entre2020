<p style="color: white;">Our product, terrariums, serve as a fun activity, decoration, and gift! We sell kits and premade terrariums in two sizes. They both consist of beads, soil, seeds, and a cute bottle. These are all the materials you need to create your terrarium, as the name suggests. We also have themed choices of beads for you to choose from, so you can customize our product for your liking. Not only is our product fun and personalizable, they are also super easy to take care of because they water themselves! Our product is very unique which sets us apart from our competitors.
