            <td> <h3>How did we decide on Jars?</h3>Hi there! Our names are Ria, Alyssa, and Chloe. We came together and thought up the idea of Jot Jars, or pencil jars. 
                This idea came up when we were trying to decide what to do, and I looked at my desk and saw my jar holding my pencils and pens. 
                During remote learning, everyone is working at home.</td>

            <td> <h3>Why should you use a Jar?</h3>So you donâ€™t need a pencil pouch to carry your pens around because you are always working in the same place. 
                Everyone needs a little fun in their lives right now, so why not add some color to your jar?

        <td>   <h3>More about Jot Jars</h3>Jot Jars are adorable desk accesories you can keep stationary in and give as a gift, 
                they aren't really jars, more like pencil holders that help you out with organization, 
                especially this year with all of us stuck at home and having a desk.

        <td>   <h3>Why would you use a Jar?</h3>Not just good looking, but also useful for keeping your desk for being messy, they come in all shapes and sizes
