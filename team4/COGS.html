   <h1> The PV Process: </h1>
        <p> To make our calenders We use 100% self-taken photos and hand-painted watercolor for our backgrounds.
        We both love art so we try to make it a big part of our design. Along with our backgrounds, we have a handmade calendar template made on google slides. 
          Through the art, we get to express feelings and create different themes.The PV process is fun and self-expressive!

    </p>

    <h1> Why PV? </h1>
    <p> 
        Our company works together and is based on kindness, friendship, hard work, and achievement of goals.
         We always support each otherâ€™s ideas and work off of support and advice.
          We make calendars; this is no easy task. With more hands-on-deck, we will be able to make calendars faster and better.
           We are positive this company will be a good choice for you! You as a PV team member will be supported, cherished, and have fun!
