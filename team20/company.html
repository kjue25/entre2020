        We are a group of seventh graders who are working together to make our first company. 
        We are very excited to have you here and we hope to intrest you in our designs.
        Our team consists of three people, Penelope, Jasmeet, and Lillian. 
        All three of us have been interested in art and drawing and found stickers
        really as a really solid product.
