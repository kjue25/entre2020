        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Welcome to Pack-A-Mask! </br>
            Every time you take off your mask, or bring it around with you, you bring unnecessary risks to your health and mask.<img src="Content3(1).png" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px; width: 150; height: 150;" alt="image4" class="popup1"></br>Instead of wasting the precious filters(N95 or otherwise), which are expensive and hard to come by, you can preserve</br>the lifespan of your mask’s filter. Pack-A-Mask is a double-layered bag of fabric, that is an additional layer of</br>protection, to keep away germs and bacteria from your mask. This washable and reusable mask bag has a button to keep</br>  your mask safe, all the while keeping a slight pocket of air at the top. This prevents germs and bacteria from</br>growing within a humid and damp environment. Finally, this bag also has a metal clasp to attach to your jeans, or bag</br>for easy portability. You won’t have to worry about looks either. This bag has patterned fabric, and bright colors,</br>that will make sure you won’t lose the bag, and will catch the attention of others.</p>
