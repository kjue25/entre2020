    <h3> Q &ndash; What makes you stand out from the other companies? </h3>
    <p> A &ndash; There are many things that make Pinned stand out from other companies. Within seventh grade entre, we are the only team doing decorations with letters and symbols. Uniquely from Pinned are the inspirational quote tags. When people buy our
        products, we want to give them something more than a pin board. Especially during the pandemic, everyone could use a bit more inspiration. So we put a variety of inspirational quotes on all of our products to make people feel happier. </p>

    <h3> Q &ndash; What inspired you to do this project? </h3>
    <p> A &ndash; Our main motivation for this choice was that it was unique and would be fun to make. Because we are the only team doing this kind of decoration, it means that we have the benefit of low competition, and more customers buying our products
        specifically. </p>

    <h3> Q &ndash; What is your team&rsquo;s work culture? </h3>
    <p> A &ndash; Pinned is based on helping customers be happy. Not just giving customers exactly hat they want, but inspiring them to feel a little happier, or motivated to accomplish a goal. We also care about ideas. If someone on the team has an idea or
        an opinion, it will be thought over, and never shot down. You can count on being happy and motivated as a customer, investor, or team member. </p>

        <h3>Q &ndash; What other benefits does your team have?</h3>
        <p> A &ndash; If you take a look at our cost of goods (found on the home page), then you can see that our products only cost about &dollar;3.00 to make. We also use softwood for our products to save money, and time without lowering our quality. Softwood is also better for
            the environment, considering that the trees it comes from are more easily grown than hardwood trees. We are planning on selling our products for &dollar;5-7, which gets us a profit of &dollar;2.00-&dollar;4.00. </p>
