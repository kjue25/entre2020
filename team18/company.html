<h2>Company Story</h2>
<h4>Our team is productive and we all work well together.  We all keep each other on task. We all are pretty chill so we can easily make a decision. We work hard while getting to know each other better. Sidney wrote the code with help from Neha and Zoe, Neha did the cost of goods and wrote the product description, while Zoe made the logo and wrote the company story. We all hope you enjoy our product and consider buying our amazing quality necklaces and earrings.
