        <h2> Our story</h2>
        <p>
        "Linked" started as just a random pile of different ideas that along the way started to 
        form into what our product is today. Our first ideas started off as candles, stickers, and rubber band balls.
        All of these product ideas were vastly different but we came up with a comprimise that would combine our
        product ideas into a kind of first draft for our product now. We though of keychains, this product had much potential 
        combine all of these different ideas and still does. Our ideas formed into three seperate keychain ideas, 
        feather keychains, a kind of drawing or clay chram, and plastic design keychain. Over the course of the next two 
        weeks following those improved ideas, we sent out a google survey to find out which idea would be most popular
        to decide on our final product. The most popular idea that we had sent out was feather keychains! After we got our data back, 
        we still wanted to include all of our ideas into the product. Since the most popular idea was the feather keychain, website
        decided that we should have it as a sort of main centerpeice, we still wanted to incorporate our other ideas so we thought that
        we could just add them on to the main part of the product. Whcih is what the idea for charms came from. We decided that we
        should make smaller versions of our prevoious ideas to add on to the feather keychain. Soon after, the second round started
        and we started looking back on our previous data from the survey. We started to come up with some ideas for the colors and 
        designs for our different charms and feathers. We wrapped up the cost of goods, and are working on our logo to with our company 
        name. We hope that you join us and we can work towards creating a product that we can all be proud of with all of our ideas! :)
